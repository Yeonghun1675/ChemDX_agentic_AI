      "[TrendAgent] Result: There is a positive monotonic trend between emission max and decay time, with a Spearman correlation of 0.48. As decay time increases, the emission max tends to shift towards longer wavelengths, moving from blue to green and further towards red. This trend can be explained by the fact that longer decay times often correspond to lower energy transitions, which emit light at longer wavelengths. This is due to the influence of factors like crystal field effects and non-radiative transition rates.\n",
